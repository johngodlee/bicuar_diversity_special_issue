\abstract{Seasonally dry woodlands are the dominant land cover across southern Africa. They are biodiverse, structurally complex and important for ecosystem service provision. Species composition and structure varies across the region producing a diverse array of woodland types. Woodlands of the Hu\'{i}la plateau in southwest Angola represent the extreme southwestern extent of the miombo eco-region and are markedly drier than woodlands found elsewhere. They remain understudied however, compared to woodlands further east. We conducted a plot-based study of woodlands in Bicuar National Park, southwest Angola, comparing tree species composition and woodland structure with plots in Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We found that plots in Bicuar National Park had low tree species diversity, but contained 28 tree species not found in other plots. Plots in Bicuar had low basal area with notable exceptions in plots dominated by \textit{Baikiaea plurijuga}. In a comparison of plots within the Park situated in areas previously disturbed by shifting cultivation, we found that species diversity was marginally higher in previously disturbed plots than undisturbed plots. This study lends support that Bicuar National Park and the woodlands of the Hu\'{i}la plateau should be a conservation priority, representing a unique woodland mosaic with an uncommon mixture of woodland types in a small area.}

\section{Introduction}

Tropical woodlands extend over 12 countries in central and southern Africa, with an estimated area of \textasciitilde{}3.7 million km\textsuperscript{2} \citep{White1987, Mayaux2004, Arino2010}. Within this, miombo woodlands are the dominant vegetation type, characterised by trees of the \textit{Brachystegia} and \textit{Julbernadia} genera, both within the Fabaceae family, subfamily Detaroideae \citep{Chidumayo1997, Campbell2002, Azani2017}. These genera are seldom found outside miombo woodlands, while their contribution to the biomass of miombo woodlands varies throughout the region \citep{Campbell2002}. Across the range of southern African woodlands, variation in climate, edpahic factors, disturbance regimes and biogeography maintain a diverse array of woodland types in terms of both species composition and physical woodland structure \citep{Privette2004, Caylor2004, Chidumayo2002}. 

Southern African woodlands are structurally complex but species poor in the tree layer compared to dry tropical forests which exist at similar latitudes \citep{DRYFLOR2016, Torello-raventos2013}. These woodlands contain many endemic tree species however, and support a highly diverse woodland understorey, with an estimated 8500 species of vascular plants \citep{Frost1996}. Miombo woodlands are a conservation priority, especially considering their importance for ecosystem service provision for an estimated 150 million people \citep{Ryan2016}. Additionally miombo woodlands hold \textasciitilde{}18-24 Pg C in woody biomass and soil organic carbon, which is comparable to that held in the rainforests of the Congo basin (\textasciitilde{}30 Pg C) \citep{Mayaux2008}. Despite their importance, dry tropical woodlands remain understudied compared to wet forests across the globe \citep{Clarke2017}. 

Over the previous two decades, the limited ecological research in southern African woodlands has been concentrated in the central and eastern parts of the miombo region, notably in southern Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia. The south-western extent of miombo woodlands, which is found entirely within Angola has received considerably less attention \citep{Huntley2019}. Partly this is due to diminished research capacity during the Angolan civil war following the country's independence, which took place officially between 1975 and 2002, but with sporadic localised periods of civil unrest until around 2012 \citep{Oliveira2015}. While botanical surveys of woodlands in this region are more plentiful \citep{Huntley2019, Figueiredo2009}, joint studies of woodland species composition and physical structure remain scarce. This is despite the value of these studies in helping to estimate woodland net primary productivity, carbon sequestration potential, and studies of community assemblage. To properly understand spatial variation in woodland species composition and physical structure across the region, it is necessary to fill understudied gaps in the miombo eco-region such as those in southwest Angola.

The miombo woodlands of southwest Angola are found in their most intact form in Bicuar National Park and to a lesser extent in the adjacent Mupa National Park, on the Hu\'{i}la plateau \citep{Chisingui2018}. Both of these national parks have been protected to varying extents since 1938 \cite{Huntley2019}. These woodlands exist in much drier conditions than other miombo woodlands, precipitation diminishes rapidly within the Hui\'{i}la plateau towards the Angolan coast and the Namib desert (\hyperref[plot_map]{Figure 1a}). The vegetation of the Hu\'{i}la plateau holds many endemic species, around 83 endemic Fabaceae species \citep{Soares2007} and the most endemic plant species of any part of Angola \citep{Figueiredo2008}. \citet{Linder2001} and \citet{Droissart2018} both identify the western portion of the Hu\'{i}la plateau as a centre of tropical African endemism.

Much of the historic miombo woodland area in southwest Angola surrounding the Bicuar and Mupa National Parks has been deforested in recent years, with a clear increase in deforestation activity since the end of the civil war owing to an increase in rural population and agricultural activity \citep{Schneibel2013, Huntley2019}. The western extent of miombo woodlands found within Bicuar National Park plateau are therefore of great importance for conservation as a refuge for wildlife and endemic plant species \citep{Huntley2019}.

It is important to focus not only on areas of intact woodland areas but also that of previously disturbed land in order to properly assess the biodiversity and woodland structure of the Park. Woodland disturbance through grazing and shifting cultivation practices produce novel habitats which are not necessarily of lower conservation value \citep{McNicol2015, Goncalves2017}. Since Bicuar National Park's rejuvenation following the reinforcement of park boundaries after the civil war, many areas of woodland that were previously heavily grazed, farmed, and used for timber extraction have been allowed to re-establish and are now protected from further human resource extraction. This presents a unique opportunity to compare the species composition of these disturbed areas with areas of nearby woodland that have not been farmed in living memory.

In this study we present results of the tree diversity and woodland structure of miombo woodlands found at the far western extent of miombo woodlands in Bicuar National Park, Hu\'{i}la province, Angola. Our study utilised permanent biodiversity monitoring plots set up within the park in 2018 and 2019. We compare the tree diversity and woodland structure of Bicuar National Park with other areas of miombo woodland across the miombo eco-region using a common plot biodiversity census methodology. In addition, we take advantage of a unique opportunity to compare the tree species composition of areas of abandoned and now protected farmland that have begun to re-establish as woodland.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Study area}

The miombo eco-region spans 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, extending across the continent in a band that reaches north into Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and south into the northeast of South Africa (\hyperref[plot_map]{Figure 1a}). Miombo woodlands are defined both by their tree diversity and by their structure. In true miombo woodlands species of the \textit{Brachystegia} and \textit{Julbernadia} generally hold the most biomass, forming a sparse woodland canopy. Distinct from dry tropical forests, miombo woodlands generally maintain a grassy understorey dominated by C4 grasses. Miombo woodlands are heavily structured by seasonal fire and herbivory, which often prevent the creation of a closed tree canopy which would naturally occur in the absence of these disturbances \citep{Oliveras2016, Dantas2016}. Within the miombo eco-region, other woodland types exist, notably, woodlands dominated by \textit{Baikiaea} spp. and woodlands dominated by \textit{Colophospermum mopane} \citep{Campbell1996}.

We chose three areas of miombo woodland across the region to compare with those in Bicuar National Park, Angola (S15.1$^\circ$, E14.8$^\circ$). The three sites were Gorongosa National Park in central Mozambique (S19.0$^\circ$, E34.2$^\circ$) \citep{Ryan2011}, Kilwa District in southern Tanzania (S9.0$^\circ$, E39.0$^\circ$) \citep{McNicol2018}, and the Mikembo Natural Reserve in Katanga, southern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (S11.5$^\circ$, E27,7$^\circ$) \citep{Muledi2017}. Within each of these woodland sites, multiple one hectare square plots had been installed previously to monitor biodiversity and biomass dynamics. We used these previous censuses, collected between 2012 and 2019, to estimate tree biodiversity and woodland structure. Sites range in Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) from 864 mm y\textsuperscript{-1} in Angola to 1115 mm y\textsuperscript{-1} in the DRC. Mean Annual Temperature ranges from \textasciitilde{}20.5 $^\circ$C in Angola and DRC to \textasciitilde{}25.8 $^\circ$C in Tanzania (\hyperref[temp_precip]{Figure 1b}).

Bicuar National Park covers an area of \textasciitilde{}7900 km\textsuperscript{2}, established as a hunting reserve in 1938, and later as a national park in 1964 (\autoref{bicuar_map}). While fauna populations in the Park were severely damaged by the Angolan civil war, the interior of the Park remains as a largely intact mosaic of miombo woodland, Baikiaea-Burkea woodland, shrub/thicket vegetation and seasonally flooded grassland. Encroachment of agriculture and grazing, particularly along the northwest and western boundaries of the park, has led to a fragmented park boundary with patches of diminished thicket and woodland in areas of previously farmed land that have since been protected since park boundaries were re-established following the end of the civil war.

\subsection{Plot data collection}

We sampled \nplotsbicuar{} one hectare plots in Bicuar National Park and a total of \nplots{} plots across the miombo eco-region within four sites. \hyperref[plot_map]{Figure 1a} and \autoref{group_descrip} show the locations and general description of each site, respectively.

Within each plot, every tree stem >5 cm stem diameter was recorded. For each tree stem the species and stem diameter were recorded. Tree species were identified using local botanists at each site and taxonomy was later checked against Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) records using the \texttt{taxize} package in R \citep{taxize}. In all sites \citet{Palgrave2003} was used as a guide for species identification in the field. Specimens that could not be identified were described as morphospecies. All species in Bicuar National Park were identified. Tree coppicing due to fire, herbivory, and human actions is common in miombo woodlands. For trees with multiple stems, the identity of the parent tree was recorded.  

Stem diameter was recorded at 1.3 m from the ground along the stem as per convention using a diameter tape measure. Where stem abnormalities were present at 1.3 m from the ground, which precluded the accurate estimation of stem diameter at 1.3 m, the stem diameter was recorded at the nearest 10 cm increment above 1.3 m without significant stem abnormalities \citep{Kershaw2017}. To ensure consistency among stem diameter values recorded at different heights, when the stem diameter was recorded at a height other than 1.3 m the stem diameter at 1.3 m was estimated from the recorded stem diameter using a cubic polynomial allometric equation which adjusts for tree stem taper. This allometric equation was calibrated on 100 stems measured at multiple heights in Niassa Province, Mozambique (\hyperref[appendixa]{Appendix A}). Stems below 10 cm stem diameter were not measured in the DRC plots. We therefore estimated the number of 5-10 cm stems from the average proportion of 5-10 cm stems in all other plots. We gathered first that there was not a significant difference between sites in the proportion of 5-10 cm stems using an ANOVA (\lmsmallstems{}).

In addition to the one hectare plots across the miombo eco-region, we compared the tree biodiversity of intact areas of miombo woodland in Bicuar National Park with areas of woodland around the edge of the park that had been previously farmed or heavily grazed and had since been abandoned and reclaimed within the Park boundaries. We identified areas previously farmed with the help of park rangers and local residents who identified areas used previously for farming and grazing from memory. We conducted \ndegradplots{} plot surveys of woodland diversity and structure around the edge of the Park in previously farmed woodland in 20x50 m (0.1 ha) plots and compared those with 20x50 m subsamples of the \nplotsbicuar{} one hectare plots within the Park interior. Like the one hectare plots, within these smaller 20x50 m plots we recorded the species and stem diameter of every tree stem >5 cm stem diameter.

\subsection{Climatic data}

The WorldClim dataset \citep{Fick2017} was used to gather data on plot-level climatic conditions. We estimated Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) as the mean of total annual precipitation values between 1970 and 2000, and Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) as the mean of mean annual temperatures between 1970 and 2000. The standard deviation of monthly precipitation and temperature were calculated to provide an estimate of the seasonality of these variables. We estimated Climatic Water Deficit (CWD) for each plot according to \citep{Chave2014}, as the sum of the difference between monthly rainfall and monthly evapotranspiration when the difference is negative, using the dataset available at \url{http://ups-tlse.fr/pantropical_allometry.htm}.

% http://chave.ups-tlse.fr/pantropical_allometry.htm#CWD

\subsection{Data analysis}

We calculated the basal area (BA) of each stem using:

\begin{equation}
	\text{BA} = \pi{} \times (D / 2)^{2}
\end{equation}

Where $D$ is the estimated stem diameter at 1.3 m having accounted for tree taper. We then calculated the total basal area of each plot as the sum of each stem's basal area. For the DRC plots which lacked 5-10 cm stems, we estimated basal area in this stem diameter class from the mean proportional basal area of 5-10 cm stems in all other plots. We gathered first that there was not a significant difference between sites in the proportional basal area of 5-10 cm stems using an ANOVA (\lmbasmallstems{}).


%We also calculated Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) for each plot using the \texttt{BIOMASS} R package \citep{BIOMASS}. This method uses an adapted version of the original equation by \citet{chave2014}. AGB of a stem is calculated as:

%\begin{equation}
%	AGB = e^{(-2.024 - 0.896E + 0.920\log{WD} + 2.795\log{D} - (0.0461\log{D})^2)}
%\end{equation}

%Where $e$ is the natural constant, $E$ is a measure of environmental stress estimated by the coordinates of the plot, $WD$ is the wood density of the stem, $D$ is the stem diameter, in this case estimated at 1.3 m accounting for tree taper. Wood density is estimated for each species from the global wood density database for each species where possible \citep{Chave2009, Zanne2009}. Wood density for species without species level estimates was estimated from the mean of the respective genus. We calculated plot level AGB as a the sum of each stem's AGB.

All diversity measures were calculated on tree-level data, rather than stem-level data, to avoid artificial inflation of abundance for those species which readily coppice. We calculated the alpha diversity of each plot using the Shannon-Wiener index ($H'$) %(\autoref{shannon}), 
using the \texttt{vegan} package in R \citep{vegan}.
We calculated the pairwise beta diversity among sites using the S\o{}rensen coefficient ($S_{S}$) %(\autoref{sorensen}) 
\citep{Koleff2003}.
We calculated $S_{S}$ for each pairwise combination of plots between pairwise sites, then calculated the mean of these values of $S_{S}$, producing a single value of $S_{S}$ for each pairwise combination of sites \citep{Baselga2012}. The value of $S_{S}$, which ranges between zero and one, was multiplied by 100 to give a ``percentage similarity'' between communities in species composition.
We estimated abundance evenness for each plot using Shannon equitability index ($E_{H'}$) \citep{Smith1996} which is the ratio of $H'$ to the log transformed species richness.%(\autoref{shannon_equit}), where $H'$ is the Shannon-Wiener index $S$ is tree species richness.

%\begin{equation}
%	H' = - \sum_{i = 1}^{s} p_{i} \ln{p_i}
%	\label{shannon}
%\end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
% 	D = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{s} n(n - 1)}{N(N - 1)}
% 	\label{simpson}
% \end{equation}


%\begin{equation}
%	S_{S} = \frac{2a}{2a + b + c}
%	\label{sorensen}
%\end{equation}

%Where $a$ is the number of species shared between two plots, $b$ is the number of species unique to plot 1 and $c$ is the number of species unique to plot 2. $S_{S}$ multiplies the value of $a$ by 2 in order to give greater weight to those species shared between plot groups. 
%


%\begin{equation}
%	\begin{gathered}
%		E_{H'} = \frac{H'}{\ln{S}} \\
%	\end{gathered}
%	\label{shannon_equit}
%\end{equation}

We used Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) to assess the variation in species composition within and between one hectare plots, and also between previously farmed and non-disturbed 20x50 m plots within Bicuar National Park, using the \texttt{vegan} R package. The number of dimensions for NMDS was minimised while ensuring the stress value of the NMDS fit was <0.1. NMDS analyses were run with 500 random restarts to ensure a global solution was reached. We used the Bray-Curtis distance measure in order to robustly deal with instances of species not being shared between plots \citep{Legendre2013}. We fit plot-level estimates of MAP, MAT and the seasonality of MAP and MAT to the resulting ordination to investigate how these environmental factors influenced the grouping of species composition among plots. We calculated MAP and MAT seasonality as the mean of the standard deviation of monthly precipitation and temperature, respectively, for each of the 18 years of available data.  All analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1 \citep{RCoreTeam2019}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Alpha diversity}

In Bicuar National Park we measured a total of \nbicuartrees{} trees within the one hectare plots, and a total of \ntrees{} trees across all sites. Trees in Bicuar National Park belonged to \nbicuarspecies{} species within \nbicuarfamilies{} families. Across all four sites we recorded \nspecies{} species from \nfamilies{} families. The most diverse family within each site and among all plots was Fabaceae with \nfabaceaespecies{} species. \nbicuaruniquespecies{} tree species were found in Bicuar National Park which were not found in the other miombo woodland plots (\autoref{bicuar_species}). The most common of these unique species were \textit{Brachystegia tamarindoides} (n = \nbg{}), \textit{Baikiaea plurijuga} (n = \nbp{}) and \textit{Baphia massaiensis} (n = \nbm{}). Four species unique to Bicuar National Park only had one individual recorded: \textit{Elachyptera parvifolia}, \textit{Entandrophragma spicatum}, \textit{Oldfieldia dactylophylla}, \textit{Peltophorum africanum}.

Alpha diversity in Bicuar National Park was low compared to other sites (\autoref{div_box}). Mean $H'$ across plots in Bicuar National Park was \bicuarshannon{}. An ANOVA showed a significant difference in $H'$ between sites (\lmshannon{}), and a post-hoc Tukey's test showed that $H'$ in plots in Bicuar National Park was significantly different from those in DRC ($H'$ = \drcshannon{}, \tukeyshannonbicuardrc{}), Mozambique ($H'$ = \nhamshannon{}, \tukeyshannonbicuarnham{}) and Tanzania ($H'$ = \kilwashannon{}, \tukeyshannonbicuarkilwa{}). Variation in $H'$ is large within Bicuar National Park, but this was similar to the other sites, with $H'$ ranging from \bicuarminshannon{} to \bicuarmaxshannon{}. In contrast, the range of species richness within Bicuar National Park was much lower than other sites, suggesting that the wide range in $H'$ was caused by variation in abundance evenness.

\subsection{Beta diversity}

The NMDS of plot species composition among one hectare plots was run with four dimensions. The stress value was \nmdsstress{}. Plot diversity in Bicuar National Park formed three distinct groups. Bicuar plots 9, 13, and 15 were dominated by \textit{Baikiaea plurijuga}, \textit{Baphia massaiensis} and \textit{Croton gratissimus} according to species scores from the NMDS. Bicuar plots 4, 11, and 12 were dominated by \textit{Brachystegia tamarindoides}, \textit{Ochna pulchra} and \textit{Elachyptera parvifolia}. The third group consisting of the remaining 7 plots surprisingly had a species composition most similar to that of plots in the DRC group. This group is dominated by \textit{Pterocarpus lucens}, \textit{Strychnos pungens} and \textit{Bridelia mollis}. All environmental factors fitted to the NMDS ordination significantly influenced the grouping of plots (\autoref{all_nmds_envfit}). MAT explained the most variation in plot position on the first two NMDS axes (\nmdsmat{}), followed by the seasonality of MAP (\nmdsmapsd{}), MAP (\nmdsmap{}) and the seasonality of MAT (\nmdsmatsd{}). Variation in MAP drove much of the difference between plots in Bicuar National Park and those in Tanzania and Mozambique. 

The pairwise S\o{}rensen coefficient of percentage similarity showed that the species composition of plots in Bicuar National Park had low similarity with other sites in the study (\autoref{pairs_js}). Similar to the NMDS, these results show that plots in Bicuar National Park are most similar to those found in DRC.

\subsection{Woodland structure}

Mean basal area of plots in Bicuar National Park was \babicuar{} m\textsuperscript{2} ha\textsuperscript{-1}, ranging from \bicuarbamin{} to \bicuarbamax{} m\textsuperscript{2} ha\textsuperscript{-1} (\autoref{div_box}). An ANOVA showed a significant difference in basal area among sites (\lmba{}), and a post-hoc Tukey's test showed that basal area in Bicuar National Park was significantly lower than plots in DRC (BA = \badrc{} m\textsuperscript{2} ha\textsuperscript{-1}, \tukeybabicuardrc{}) but there was no significant difference between Bicuar and Mozambique (BA = \banham{} m\textsuperscript{2} ha\textsuperscript{-1}, \tukeybabicuarnham{}) or Tanzania (BA = \bakilwa{} m\textsuperscript{2} ha\textsuperscript{-1}, \tukeybabicuarkilwa{}) (\autoref{div_box}). Additionally, Bicuar plots had less variation in basal area between plots than other sites. Plots in Bicuar with the highest basal area were dominated by \textit{Baikiaea plurijuga} and \textit{Baphia massaiensis} (Plots 9, 13, and 15). 

% All plots in Bicuar National Park had a total basal area lower than \threshbabicuar{} m\textsuperscript{2} ha\textsuperscript{-1}

Stem diameter abundance distribution in Bicuar National Park was comparable with other sites (\autoref{stem_ab_dbh_bin}). The slope of log mean stem size distribution among diameter bins was \dbhslopebicuar{} in Bicuar National Park, \dbhslopedrc{} in DRC, \dbhslopekilwa{} in Tanzania, and \dbhslopenham{} in Mozambique.  

\subsection{Effect of disturbance via shifting cultivation on diversity within Bicuar National Park}

There was a marginal difference in the species composition of previously farmed woodland plots and intact woodland plots, but with some overlap (\autoref{bicuar_degrad_nmds}). Notably, Plots 4 and 7 in non-disturbed woodland have a species composition more resembling the previously farmed plots. These two plots were dominated by \textit{Brachystegia tamarindoides} and \textit{Burkea africana}.  The non-farmed plots 15, 13, and 9 represent distinct outliers in the NMDS. These three plots were dominated by \textit{Baikiaea plurijuga} which was not encountered in the disturbed plots. The most common species in the disturbed plots was \textit{Baphia massaiensis} (n = \nbmdegrad{}), while in the intact plots the most common species was \textit{Julbernadia paniculata} (n = \njpdegrad{}). Mean alpha diversity was marginally higher in previously farmed plots ($H'$ = \degradshannon{}) than in intact plots ($H'$ = \bicuarsubshannon{}) and an ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in $H'$ between the two groups of plots (\lmshannondegrad{}). Mean plot species richness was also lower in non-farmed plots (\bicuarsubrich{}) than previously farmed plots (\degradrich{}). Mean basal area was higher in non-farmed plots (\bicuarsubba{} m\textsuperscript{2} ha\textsuperscript{-1}) than previously farmed plots (\degradba{} m\textsuperscript{2} ha\textsuperscript{-1}). Mean $E_{H'}$ was \degradequit{} in disturbed plots and \bicuarsubequit{} in non-disturbed plots but there was no significant difference between disturbed and non-disturbed plots (\lmequitdegrad{}). \ndegradonlyspecies{} species were found only in the disturbed plots and not in the non-disturbed plots. The most common of these were \textit{Combretum celastroides} (n = \nccdegrad{}), \textit{Acacia reficiens} (n = \nvrdegrad{}), and \textit{Gardenia ternifolia} (n = \ngtdegrad{}).

\section{Discussion}

We compared the tree species diversity and woodland structure of arid woodlands in Bicuar National Park in southwest Angola with three other woodland sites across the miombo eco-region. Our results show that Bicuar National Park is distinct in both woodland structure and species composition from these other woodlands. Notably, plots in Bicuar National Park contained 28 tree species which did not occur in other plots. This lends support for the Hu\'{i}la Plateau as an important area for conservation of southern African woodland landscapes. The woodlands in Bicuar National Park were of low tree basal area, with few large trees except in plots dominated by \textit{Baikiaea plurijuga}. Many other studies have drawn a relationship between water availability and basal area \citep{Terra2018, Strickland2016}, and our study supports this, with Bicuar National Park being the most arid of the four sites considered in our study. The NMDS of species composition also showed that plots in Bicuar National Park are heavily influenced by aridity. 

Within Bicuar National Park, three distinct woodland types were identified. The first, dominated by \textit{Baikiaea plurijuga} and \textit{Baphia massaiensis} represents the Baikiaea woodland type commonly found to the south of the miombo eco-region \citep{Timberlake2010}. This is supported by \citet{Chisingui2018} which also found Baikiaea woodlands as a distinct woodland type in the Park. \textit{B. plurijuga} have been identified as an important species for conservation, being attractive to selective logging due to their large stature \citep{Ngandwe2017, Wallenfang2015}. The woodlands created by \textit{B. plurijuga} are also an important habitat for elephants (\textit{Loxodonta africana}) \citep{Sianga2017, Mukwashi2012}, with Bicuar National Park and Mupa National Park being key refugia in the Hu\'{i}la plateau region. The second woodland type, dominated by \textit{Brachystegia tamarindoides} and \textit{Ochna pulchra} represents a form of small stature woodland with a shrubby understorey and sparse canopy trees which commonly occurs as a result of repeated disturbance by fire, or poor soil structure \citep{Smith2004}. The remaining plots resemble the more common true miombo woodland with \textit{Julbernadia paniculata}, though with a number of species additions not seen in plots further to the east of the miombo eco-region such as \textit{Strychnos pungens}. This mosaic of woodland types makes Bicuar National Park a valuable habitat and strengthens the case for the Park being a key conservation asset within the Hu\'{i}la plateau and the larger southern African region.

Previously disturbed woodlands around the edge of Bicuar National Park were found to share many species with intact areas the Park but with some additions which did not occur in undisturbed plots, leading to a distinct woodland composition. The species diversity of these previously disturbed patches was higher than was found in the intact plots. Other studies have shown a peak in species richness during woodland regrowth as pioneer species take advantage of a low competition environment, while some later stage woodland species remain from before the original disturbance \citep{Goncalves2017, Kalaba2013}. The species most common in the disturbed plots were \textit{Combretum psidioides}, \textit{Combretum collinum} and \textit{Terminalia sericea}, all of which tend to remain as smaller highly coppiced trees rather than grow to larger canopy trees in disturbed woodlands \citep{Wyk2014}. There was a lack of species which tend to grow to large canopy trees in these disturbed plots, possibly due to them being repeatedly felled for timber prior to reclamation by the Park, or due to them being unable to recruit into a more open, shrubby woodland. Despite this effect, some disturbed plots had a greater basal area than undisturbed plots, possibly due to high levels of coppicing in these plots. This can lead to species that would otherwise remain small producing a much larger basal area as they grow multiple stems under high disturbance conditions \citep{Luoga2004}.

In conclusion, the woodlands of Bicuar National Park represent an important woodland refugia at the far western extent of the miombo eco-region. These woodlands, both those disturbed by previous farming activity and those which remain undisturbed, possess a number of species not found commonly in other miombo woodland plots around the region. Bicuar National Park should be considered a key conservation asset within the Hu\'{i}la plateau and within the miombo eco-region as a whole as a successfully protected example of an arid woodland mosaic.
