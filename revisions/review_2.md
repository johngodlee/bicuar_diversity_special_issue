Comments and Suggestions for Authors

The authors present a statistically sound exploratory analysis of diversity and structural patterns across tropical dry woodlands of Africa. The paper was easy to read, and no doubt offers important description of ecological patterns that as the author's describe are lacking in the literature. I did find a few priority concerns that I encourage the authors to consider:

Comment: I believe the titles of MDPI articles are required to be in title case.
* I have capitalized the title

Comment: The first is adding species referenced in the text to the ordination diagrams. Ordination diagrams can become unwieldy at times. However, to improve interpretation with the text this should be considered – at a minimum for the species referenced in the text.
* The species scores for those species referenced in the text have now been included in both Figure 4 and Figure 7 and labelled.

Comment: Second, Figure 6 is not referenced in the text. Also, based on the progression of text in the results, it would appear that Figure 6 would indeed actually be Figure 7, as the ordination results begin this section.
* Based on the comments by another reviewer, the location of figures within the text has been altered to place the figures close to their first occurrence in the text, which has additionally swapped Figure 6 and Figure 7 as you suggest.

Comment: I was also confused about section 3.5 including all of the Figure and Tables. I was expecting to see them spread throughout the text as per the author guidelines of Diversity: "All Figures, Schemes and Tables should be inserted into the main text close to their first citation and must be numbered following their number of appearance (Figure 1, Scheme I, Figure 2, Scheme II, Table 1, etc.)."
* This was a misunderstanding arising from the MDPI LaTeX template, which contains a section for "Figures, Tables and Schemes" separate to the "Results" section. Figures and tables now appear close to their first citation in the main text.

Comment: Figure 1a should include an inset map of Africa, or just include the full extent of Africa. This will improve georeferencing for the reader.
* This figure has been updated to include the entire African continental land mass, to aid reader interpretation.

Comment: Line 36: I do not believe south-western should be hyphenated
* "south-western has been changed to "southwestern"

Comment: Line 43: I believe you mean to say "community assembly" rather than "community assemblage"
* "community assemblage" changed to "community assembly"

Comment: Line 70: I take some objection to the use of "permanent" in the describing the Bicuar plot data, considering it was established and censused within the last 2 years. I think this sentence could be reframed to describe the Bicuar sampling as designed to match previous sampling efforts and establish a regional, permanent monitoring effort across miombo woodlands. It might seem like semantics, but "permanent" is often synonymous with "longterm". I think this sentence, as I provide in the example above, also allows you to bring in the previously established efforts as well, to more clearly indicate that your work is a comparison across sites sampled within 2012-2019. Please consider ways to improve the clarity in this important paragraph.
* Changed: "Our study utilised recently installed biodiversity monitoring plots set up within the park in 2018 and 2019. We compare the tree diversity and woodland structure of Bicuar National Park with biodiversity monitoring plots previously established in other areas of miombo woodland across the miombo ecoregion which use a common plot biodiversity census methodology."

Comment: Line 105-106: Please consider revising this sentence to ensure that readers understand all 64 plots were 1 ha in size.
* Added: "and a total of 64 one hectare plots across the miombo ecoregion across four sites"

Comment: Line 178: It is generally unconventional to begin a sentence with a #. Please consider revising this sentence.
* Changed: "We encountered 27 tree species in Bicuar National Park which were not found in the other miombo woodland plots"

Comment: Line 205-206: The projection of environmental factors onto the ordination is correlative. Your description of explained variance in the previous sentence(s) is fine and correct in describing the fit of these data and relationships with floristic variation in the ordination. However, I would prefer that "drove" be replaced with a more conservative description, such as "corresponded with", to remove challenges with assigning causative relationships that these methods do not support. Also, please provide the analyses used if that not already in the text – I assume envfit in vegan was used.
* Changed: "We fit plot-level estimates of MAP, MAT, the seasonality of MAT and CWD to the first two axes of the resulting ordination using the \texttt{envfit()} function in the \texttt{vegan} R package to investigate how these environmental factors correlated with the grouping of species composition among plots"
* Changed: "All environmental factors fitted to the NMDS ordination correlated significantly with the grouping of plots (\autoref{all_nmds_envfit}). MAT explained the most variation in plot position on the first two NMDS axes (\nmdsmat{}), followed by CWD (\nmdsmapsd{}), the seasonality of MAT (\nmdsmatsd{}) and MAP (\nmdsmap{}). Variation in MAP explained much of the difference between plots in Bicuar National Park versus those in Tanzania and Mozambique."

Comment: Please add a legend to Figure 2.
* A legend describing the colours of the plot points has been added to Figure 2.

Comment: Please add species scores to Figure 4 – could only be those species referenced in the text.
* Species scores have been added to Figure 4 for those species which are mentioned in the text.

Comment: Figure is not referenced in the text.
* I will assume you are referring to Figure 6, which was not previously referenced in the text. This citation has now been added to line ...

Comment: Please add species scores to Figure 7 – could only be those species referenced in the text.
* Species scores have been added to Figure 4 for those species which are mentioned in the text.

Comment: Tables 2 and 3 include additional information, such as species counts and error, in parentheses not brackets.
* Changed "brackets" to "parantheses" in caption for Table 2 and Table 3.

Comment: Finally, I would like you do something about the disparity between the Bicuar National Park data being referenced as Angola in the Tables and Figures.  
* All references to "Angola" in the figures have been replaced with "Bicuar NP"
