Comments and Suggestions for Authors
The work deals with the description and comparison of an arid and disturbed forest area in Angola compared to other forests in miombo region. 
In my opinion, the research is interesting since it could contribute to the knowledge and to the definition of conservation policies focused on this peculiar and valuable forests. I think the manuscript needs some improvements before possible publication: 

starting from introduction: the aims of the study should be better explained with a list.

Materials and methods: the surface covered by the different study area is lack as well as the description of plots arrangement: the description of sampling design is poor and should be improved. The description of the other three study area is lack provide a synthetic description. L. 122-123 strange wording, quote. L. 163-166 describe in detail all indices used (number of specie per plot is lack) and report the formula for each of them. L.196-203 add a table with all the ANOVA results: source of variation degree of freedom, MS F and p value also for the other statistical analysis performed with ANOVA. The results of Tukey's tests should be reported in Fig. 3. and Fig. 7. 

Discussion: improve discussion about environmental variables.

* Aims of study explained with a list //
* Improve description of sampling design (plot locations?) //
* Improve description of DRC, Nhambita and Kilwa study sites //
* L122-123 - strange wording //
* L163-166 - describe in detail all indices used (Shannon-Wiener, Sorensen), report the formula for each of them. Include description of number of species per plot //
* L196-203 - table of ANOVA results, and for other ANOVA's used //
	* Shannon, basal area, shannon equitability - across sites //
	* Shannon, basal area, shannon equitability - degraded and non-degraded //

* Results of Tukey's tests should be reported in Figure 3 and Figure 7 (groupings, a,b, c etc.) //
	* Tukey's tests are not informative for statistical comparison of only two groups and so were not included in the original analysis. We have not included results of Tukey's tests in Figure 7.

* Improve discussion about environmental variables.
