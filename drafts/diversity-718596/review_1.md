Comments and Suggestions for Authors

Diversity and structure  of an arid woodland at the western Edge of the miombo ecoregion, southwest Angola

General opinion

The paper presents the diversity of the miombo ecoregion in Angola. The study was conducted in the miombo ecoregion not only in Angola but also in Tanzania, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo to compare the diversity and structure of those forests in Angola and other countries. The paper expands the knowledge of the arid woodland in southwest Africa. 

Comment: I suggest to add some results of calculations to prove the statements in the discussion.  The manuscript can be published after major revision.


Comment: I recommend to change the title of the manuscript. The title suggests that the Authors carried out the study only in Angola but it is not true.
* Title changed to "Diversity and structure of an arid woodland in southwest Angola, with comparison to the wider miombo ecoregion"

Comment: I suggest to correct the Abstract. Two things should be added: the aim of the study and the conclusion. The concluded sentence is too obvious.
* Added: "We aimed to elucidate further the diversity of southwestern Angolan woodlands and to compare this to other woodlands within the miombo ecoregion."
* Amended conclusion: "Bicuar National Park remains an important woodland refugia, with an uncommon mosaic of woodland types within a small area. Moreover, we highlight wide variation in species composition and woodland structure across the region. Future studies must incorporate plot data from across the region to make appropriate generalisations."

Comment: I suggest to add the aim of the study also into in the introduction.
* Added: To properly understand spatial variation in woodland species composition and physical structure across the miombo ecoregion, it is necessary to fill understudied gaps. In this study we aim to address one such gap in southwest Angola, and place it in context with other woodlands across the miombo ecoregion.

Comment: What does it mean C4 grasses?
* Changed "C4 grasses" to "grass species utilizing the C\textsubscript{4} carbon fixation pathway" on line ....

Comment: Why the Authors did not use the term diameter at breast height (DBH)? The diameter was measured at the height of 1.3 m.
* Added: Stem diameter was recorded at 1.3 m from the ground (diameter at breast height, DBH) along the stem as per convention using a diameter tape measure.

Comment: Line 113 – All species? All tree species?
* Added: All tree species within the Bicuar National Park plots were identified.

Comment: What was the total number of investigated plots?
* Please see line 105 in the reviewed manuscript: "We sampled 15 one hectare plots in Bicuar National Park and a total of 64 plots across the miombo". Additionally please see line 134: "We conducted 20 plot surveys of woodland diversity and structure in these areas with 20x50 m (0.1 ha) plots"

Comment: In the description of data analysis the information of ANOVA should be added (see the paragraph of alpha diversity).
* In Methods - Data Analysis added: "We analysed the difference in alpha diversity measures and woodland structural variables among groups of plots using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistical models, with a null hypothesis that there was no difference among the mean values of groups of plots. Post-hoc Tukey's HSD tests were used to investigate the degree to which pairwise combinations of plot groups differed in each case."

Comment: Line 193 – please describe the four dimensions.

Comment: Line 262 – who, except which
* Changed "which" to "who"

Comment: Line 288-290 It is a pity that the pioneer tree species were not described.
* Unfortunately as we do not have access to a time series of species establishment in the disturbed plots in Bicuar National Park we cannot reliably state which species were present as pioneers in this system. Nevertheless, we have added an indication of species which have been recorded as pioneers in other miombo woodland regeneration studies and compared them to the species found in our plots.

Comment: Line 294 – Unfortunately, the Authors did not present the results of the occurrence of the large trees near the edge of the park.
* Line 294 merely describes the lack of tree species which "tend" to form large canopy individuals in miombo woodlands, rather than pertaining to the lack of large individuals per se.

Comment: Line 297 – the same remark as above. The Authors should add the results of the number of shoots (coppice).
* During data collection the number of shoots (stems <5 cm) was not measured, therefore we are unable to report these measurements. If instead the reviewer is referring to multi-stemmedness (coppice)

Comment: The discussion should be divided into subchapters.
* I have split the discussion into subsections of:
1. Comparison of Bicuar National Park with other woodlands within the miombo ecoregion
2. Delineation of woodland types within Bicuar National Park
3. Comparison of disturbed and undisturbed woodland plots

Comment: 3 - What is MAT SD?
* Added: "The seasonality of temperature (MAT SD) was calculated as the standard deviation of ..."
